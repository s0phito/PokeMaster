To run our android app you must download and install Android Studio.

Once downloaded  you must navigate to the AndroidProjects folder in your 
computer and unzip PokeMasterFinal.zip in that folder. The folder path is
typically C:\Users\YOU\AndroidStudioProjects\. 

Create a Virtual Device:
Refer to Android's Developer page on that here:
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds

Now you will want to open Android Studio and Open the project.

Once the project is open you will want to do these 3 things:
Click Build tab ---> Clean Project

Click Build tab ---> Build APK

Click Run(The green play button).

Now you should be able to navigate through the app.
